This project is an opportunity to practice your SQL skills and prepare for the role of a Data Analyst.  This project was inspired by the [Braintree Analytics Code Challenge](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst) and was created to strengthen your SQL knowledge.

:exclamation: If you find this repository helpful, please consider giving it a :star:. Thanks! :exclamation:

**Please Note**:

This project is meant to measure/gauge/practice your technical abilities with SQL.

* All work should be done in SQL.
* Do not alter the CSV files.
* Most, if not all of these questions are intended purely as a measure of your SQL skills and not as actual questions that one would expect to answer from an employer.

I have created a [Walkthrough](walkthrough/WALKTHROUGH_DOCKER.md) if you would like to follow along and complete this challenge with me. 

The questions are listed below with the expected results and answers hidden so you can cross reference your answers.

This repository contains all of the necessary files, datasets and directories for running a PostgresSQL server in a Docker Container.  The only prerequisite is that you should already have Docker Desktop installed and running on your computer.

 https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
 
 ### Getting Started

* This project uses the latest version of `PostgreSQL`, but any SQL database may be used.
* Directories and Files details:
	* `README.md`: This is the file your are currently reading.
	* `.gitignore`: The files and directories listed in this file will be ignored by Git/GitHub.
	* `source_data/csv_data`: This is the location of the CSV files needed to copy into our database.
	* `db`: In the current directory, create an empty directory named '`db`'.  Although this directory is ignored by Git/GitHub, PostgreSQL requires a directory to keep data persistent if you are running a Docker container.  There will be no need to alter any of the files that reside there once the container starts running.
	* `images`: This is the location of the image files displayed in this repository.
	* `walkthrough/`: A directory with a beginner friendly walkthrough of all of the steps I took to complete the SQL challenge.
	* `source_data/`: This directory contains all the files and scripts within our Docker container.
	* `source_data/csv_data`: This is the location of the CSV files needed to copy/insert into our database.
	* `source_data/scripts/`: This directory will contain all sql scripts I used to complete the challenge.
	* `source_data/csv_output/`: This directory will contain all CSV files generated by some of our queries.

<h1 name="questions"></h1>### SQL Code Challenge 
<strong>1.</strong> Using the CSV files located in `source_data/csv_data`, create your new SQL tables with the properly formatted data.

* /source_data/csv_data/
	*  [countries.csv](./source_data/csv_data/countries.csv)
	*  [cities.csv](./source_data/csv_data/cities.csv)
	*  [currencies.csv](./source_data/csv_data/currencies.csv)
	*  [languages.csv](./source_data/csv_data/languages.csv)

* Add a numeric, auto-incrementing Primary Key to every table.
* In the `countries` table, add the column `created_on` with the current date.
* Create a one-to-one relationship with the countries table as the parent table.

<strong>2.</strong> List all of the regions and the total number of countries in each region.  Order by country count in descending order and capitalize the region name.
